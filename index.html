<pre><code>The work is separated into several sections in order to make it generally readable. They are:
</code></pre>

<p>Goal and Metaorganization, which covers the overarching goal of the group and how the Organizers are organized.</p>

<p>Running Hacking, which covers the meat of what we do- get people hacking.</p>

<p>Equipment, Inventory, and Money covers our ideas about equipment, what to get and how to get it.</p>

<p>Relations, Sponsors, and Conflict covers most of what remains, Terrapin Hackers’ relations to the outside world and to each other.</p>

<pre><code>This work is intended for the Organizers of Terrapin Hackers at the University of Maryland, College Park, but it is hoped that this will be useful to anyone who is trying to foster a culture of hacking wherever they are.

<p>A note on style: it will be noticed that several terms are capitalized (such as Organizer, Hackathon, Treasurer, etc.) this is the intentional styling of the organization.</p>

<a name="cover-letter" class="anchor" href="#cover-letter"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cover Letter</h1>

<p>Hello Organizers of Terrapin Hackers, both current and future! This guide represents an attempt to cultivate and collate group knowledge and experience so that this group will have a future, and a way to look at the past.  This is a reference work, it would please me to no end if you do read this all the way through, but that is in no way required or expected in order to get the maximum out of this work.  This should be seen as a living document that will (hopefully) be updated whenever procedure changes.  Most of this work is not in a terribly formal tone as this is not a terribly formal organization. </p>

<a name="the-overall-goal-terrapin-hackers" class="anchor" href="#the-overall-goal-terrapin-hackers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The overall goal Terrapin Hackers</h3>

<p>The goal of Terrapin Hackers is to get students hacking. We live in a world where the superstars are the ones that spend their time making and creating and gaining the skills therein. We want to see a huge community of people making lots of things and lots of really cool Hackathon projects. We want to not simply be a group, but to create a culture around hacking and going to hackathons that fosters a UMD hacker identity and aspirations to be a great hacker.</p>

<p>To this end, we provide the resources needed and generally try to lower the barrier to entry for everyone.</p>

<h3>
<a name="organization-of-the-organizers-of-terrapin-hackers" class="anchor" href="#organization-of-the-organizers-of-terrapin-hackers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Organization of the organizers of Terrapin Hackers</h3>

<p>The leadership of Terrapin Hackers are the Organizers of Terrapin Hackers.  This is essentially a group of committed people who run the club and mostly try to just keep things going. Membership is open to anyone that comes to Organizers meetings and gets involved. Organizers have the right and responsibility to create sub –groups focused on their area to assist them and to delegate tasks.</p>

<p>The Organizers maintain a shared Google Drive folder, make sure you have access to it when you become an Organizer!</p>

<p>It is proposed that the Organizers operate on a consensus system, where everyone must consent or stand aside in order to pass a motion. Quorum (enough people to make a decision) is defined as having at least 5 of the named positions present. </p>

<p>There are several permanent positions, which are described here:</p>

<p>President: The President’s duties are to run Organizers meetings, to be the point-of-contact with all external groups, to keep the rest of the Organizers accountable for their actions. The president is a university-mandated position. The president also serves as SGA liaison. The Presidency is an elected position</p>

<p>Vice President: The duty of the Vice President is to assist the President in any of her duties.  The Vice Presidency is an elected position. </p>

<p>Treasurer: The position of Treasurer is a university-mandated position.  The Treasurer is in charge of all financial affairs; she maintains any budget and coordinates spending with the University. The Treasurer is an elected position</p>

<p>Hacktorial Organizer: Is the point person for coordinating and organizing Hacktorials. See: Section on Hacktorials.</p>

<p>Hack Night Organizer: Is the point person for organizing and welcoming people to Hack Night. See Section on Hack Nights.</p>

<p>Hackathon Organizer: Is the point person for getting busses to and from Hackathons. See: Section on Hackathons.</p>

<p>Hardware Organizer: In charge of keeping inventory and working with Collider to optimize hacking. See: Section on Hardware.</p>

<p>Website/Social Media Organizer: Is the point person for the Terrapin Hackers social media presence. Will have access to, and will use all of, but not limited to: administration of the Terrapin Hackers Facebook page, the <a href="https://github.com/TerrapinHackers" class="user-mention">@TerrapinHackers</a> twitter handle, the terrapinhackers.com domain, the Organizers Google Drive Folder, the Terrapin Hackers GitHub group and any other social media that may exist. The website Organizer will be in charge of keeping the website updated with any relevant information. This may be multiple positions.</p>

<p>Collider Liaison: This is not a full position, and should be combined with one of the above positions. The Collider liaison is the Organizer that is the official point-of-contact with Collider as an organization. Any Terrapin Hackers + Collider meetings must include this person.</p>

<h3>
<a name="organizers-meeting-guidelines" class="anchor" href="#organizers-meeting-guidelines"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Organizers Meeting Guidelines</h3>

<p>These guidelines should not be seen as strict rules, but as a method of organization that works elsewhere and a nice system for keeping things going.  Much of this is taken from Eric Weiss’ experience with Coop Housing, University of Maryland. It is a system that really does work and really does foster communication and moves the organization forward.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The president (or someone she designates) will create an agenda about what to talk about and how long the meeting will be, and will post at least a draft 24 hours before the meeting. Any Organizer can add something to the agenda at will. </p></li>
<li><p>The Facilitator is the person who directs the flow of the meeting and makes sure time is kept to and the agenda is actually followed. Often the President, but it is at her discretion if she wishes someone else to do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone at the meeting needs to volunteer (or the President needs to volunteer someone) to take notes.  Computers and voice recognition are acceptable if they actually work. We need a record of what happens at meetings for ourselves and for those unable to be present.</p></li>
<li><p>We have the position of Stack Taker. The Stack Taker’s job is to see when someone wants to speak and add them to the list of people who want to speak. This creates order in speaking and is an excellent way of preventing chaos and confusion.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the meeting we have checkouts where we go around and say what we are going to do once the meeting is over, any tasks we are going to do.</p></li>

<h3>
<a name="running-hack-nights" class="anchor" href="#running-hack-nights"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running hack nights</h3>

<p>"Until Midnight after a Hacktorial, hackers can experience an intense bursts of creativity-without the worries of tomorrow’s class. At hack night you bring your ideas to life, anything from a new app or a possibly famous self-sorting trash can. Nothing can stop you here, and the goal is to have something created by the end of the night." (Hackers)</p>

<p>Hack nights are all about getting people to make things. We often advertise it as a mini Hackathon for 4 hours on a weekday. </p>

<p>Set up: currently we have them start at 8 and end at midnight. Usually there are just people around Collider, so we make an effort to clean up the place and make it look nice, put stuff away, and that sort of thing. So far we have had some themed hack nights such as a Valentine’s Day themed one with paper hearts and a prize of a giant chocolate Hershey’s Kiss.</p>

<p>During the Hack Night: the Organizers role is to welcome people in (there are a lot of people who come to Collider for the first time at Hack Nights), inform them of the current happenings, facilitate team formation (if applicable), obtain any supplies or information as needed.  Or she delegates any or all of the above.</p>

<p>One idea is to have something to take apart every week, be it an old printer or a piece of scientific equipment, this gives those who have no idea what to do something to do.</p>

<h3>
<a name="organizing-hackathon-trips" class="anchor" href="#organizing-hackathon-trips"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Organizing Hackathon trips</h3>

<p>"Hack nights were so good-the hacking community created the Hackathon. They are 36 hours of productive, sleepless fun. Hackathons are where we create something incredible, in a limited amount of time." (Hackers)</p>

<p>The Hackathon Organizer is responsible for obtaining busses to Hackathons. This means contacting the organizers of the Hackathon and negotiating to get one or two busses paid for by them.  Then it means calling various bus companies and obtaining quotes from them and selecting the best one, then telling the selected bus company that we will be sending the bill to the person that will be paying for it.</p>

<p>The Hackathon Organizer is also responsible for making sure that enough people know about the Hackathon and are going to get on the bus. This involves a lot of outreach. At minimum, we have created a pinned post in the Terrapin Hackers Facebook group with a Facebook event. It should be noted that the event needs to be made public and not simply accidentally private to the group. </p>

<p>We have also created a Twilio application that participant’s text their email address to before they get on the bus so we can send out messages to everyone.  </p>

<p>We are currently having an issue with people signing up for Hackathons and not showing up. What other Universities do is have people give a $10 deposit which they get back once they get on the bus.  The problem with this is that some people simply don’t have $10 to spare. Another problem with this is that it may discourage people from going to Hackathons in the first place as it creates a barrier. </p>

<p>We never want to charge students for going to Hackathons. We want to make going to Hackathons as free and as easy as possible for participants. As such, we don’t want to ever charge people to get on a bus or to participate in anything we do.  What this means is that we only really advertise the Hackathons we actually are getting a bus for.  A result of this is that we don’t know what Hackathons we will be going to, which makes it difficult to create a list or schedule of them.</p>

<p>We have previously used McLean, DOTS, and US Coachways as our charter bus sources.</p>

<a name="running-hacktorials" class="anchor" href="#running-hacktorials"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running hacktorials</h3>

<p>Hacktorials are "Your guide to the future. Beginners and experts alike can be brought up to speed about the most relevant technologies. An immensely passionate host will give one every week, followed up by an epic hack night." (Hackers). We aim to teach people something new, usually (but not exclusively) being taught by undergraduate and graduate students.  </p>

<p>Currently, Hacktorials are held on Wednesday nights from 7-9 at changing locations. Historically, they may have been held in the Computer Science lecture hall or other classrooms. </p>

<p>The Hacktorial Organizer is responsible for ensuring that there is someone ready to give the hacktorials, make sure people are aware and willing to attend, and make sure that the room is secured for use. He also coordinates a time to go over the presentation in an informal fashion, and helps out during the hacktorials for whatever is needed. </p>

<p>Currently the Hacktorial Organizer has been reaching out to those he knows in the community that would give a good talk. He looks for people who have interesting skills and asks whether they would be interested in giving a hacktorials, and he usually gets positive responses.  The Organizer </p>

<p>Previously, we tried a system of having the presenter present a day or so before the hacktorials to a board of three people who would judge it and make suggestions.  This was found to not work.</p>

<h3>
<a name="public-hacks" class="anchor" href="#public-hacks"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Public Hacks</h3>

<p>Public Hacks are hacks done outside of normal locations and events that are done primarily around the UMD campus for the purposes of fun, advertisement, and creating something cool.  These are to be a positively oriented thing that will generally reflect well on the club and University. Nothing black hat (such as putting cars on roofs) is to be associated with the group.</p>

<h3>
<a name="how-to-encourage-projects" class="anchor" href="#how-to-encourage-projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to encourage projects</h3>

<p>The primary way in which we will encourage hacking is by hacking, and having the most people hacking. To this end, we will show off peoples current projects and provide any needed resources that are requested. Maker proposes: "Keep something like an “idea rummage box" in the space, where members can throw in cool clippings and clever objects they think could inspire others. Show off the products and the process. Choose well placed shelves and wall space for showcasing examples of past projects and current activities to seed ideas and inspiration.” (Maker Media, 2013)</p>

<h2>
<a name="equipment-inventory-and-money" class="anchor" href="#equipment-inventory-and-money"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Equipment, Inventory, and Money</h2>

<p>What equipment we have and how to deal with it</p>

<p>Terrapin Hackers owns a large amount of valuable equipment. It is important that we keep track of it so that we have it to use. The first step we have decided is that equipment is generally not to leave Collider. Any exceptions should be directed towards the Hardware Organizer.  In general, we allow exceptions for things like quadcopters and GoPros, as those are primarily usable only outside collider. As well, anyone can rent things for Hackathons.  We have created a template for Hackathon equipment checkouts that is located on the Google Drive Folder.</p>

<p>Keeping equipment organized and in its place is probably one of the hardest things we do.  Most of what we have is so small, and we have not really projected the message of keeping things in the space, that much equipment is walking off.</p>

<p>Currently, we have started a system of labeling where tools go and what they are. The system seems to be a good one, however it is up to every organizer to actually tell people to put away tools so we don’t have to do it constantly ourselves.  We are in the process of getting a system of labeled boxes so we can display what hardware we have and make accessing documentation for it easier.</p>

<pre><code>The key to being Hardware Organizer not actually knowing what all the hardware does, but mostly to be willing to work with the other Organizers and Collider to optimize how it is organized and presented.  It also means being in the space very often, and helping people out when they need to find something.  It means taking initiative and realizing that everyone here is a student and really has no idea what they are doing. Talk about your ideas and then implement them. Make the system your personal hack.

The biggest problem we are going to have is the tragedy of the commons.  Briefly, the tragedy of the commons is the tendency to take an action that wholly benefits you (putting another sheep on the common green or not putting a tool away) but the downsides are shared among everyone (overgrazing and degrading of the land or not having tools in their place (Hardin, 1968). In the end, we have tools not in their place and supplies will go missing.  Harding suggests that the only way to remove this is to remove the commons aspect.  This is a dilemma. We want people to do great things, but we also want people in the future to have the resources to do things. We don’t want this to be a private club, but we do want people to care. This guidebook does not pretend to have the solution, only to show the problem is real and needs to be addressed.

<a name="what-items-we-should-buy" class="anchor" href="#what-items-we-should-buy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What items we should buy</h3>

<p>If/when money becomes available, this will be a flexible list of the priority items to obtain, as well as a general list of consumables.</p>

<p>Consumables, or items we should reasonably have to replace every so often:</p>

<a name="spending-money" class="anchor" href="#spending-money"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Spending Money</h3>

<p>Money should be spent to gain the maximum benefit to the group and longevity of funds. We currently have received money from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science.  Nobody likes bureaucracy, however we want systems that are prudent and deliberate in spending money.</p>

<p>Proposed is a method for ensuring agreement and minimization of waste. In order to spend money, there must be a quorum of Organizers that is required to include the Treasurer, either the President or the vice president, and the Hardware manager (if it is a physical item being bought). This should be presented in a document that states at minimum:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The item being purchased</p></li>
<li><p>A link to the item online</p></li>
<li><p>The total cost</p></li>
<li><p>What it will be used for</p></li>
</ol><p>Once the spending is consented to, the treasurer fills out the appropriate paperwork and submits the expense to ECE, where ECE will approve or not approve of the expense.</p>

<p>As of now, we ship to ECE in AV Williams, but we could probably start shipping to the Chemistry Building if we wanted to.</p>

<pre><code>We currently do not have money that is simply ours. It is against our purpose to charge students for access to materials and/or anything we do as a club.  At times, when we can’t get a bus to a Hackathon, we do not officially promote the event, though we like to see people self-organize on Facebook.

<p>The University and ECE have stated that we are not alowed</p>

<p>Inevitably, people will break things.  We want to foster a culture that avoids punishment, as that will simply lead to things being unreported. If something is of minimal value, we won’t worry about it, as long as the person is not breaking things intentionally.   If something is more valuable, and it was an accident, it is ok, we should just talk about it at the next organizers meeting.  </p>

<h3>
<a name="conflict-resolution" class="anchor" href="#conflict-resolution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conflict resolution</h3>

<p>Conflict will inevitably happen. We establish a culture that will work to recognize each other’s feelings and acknowledge that we are not purely rational creatures (NASCO Institute, 2008). Everyone here wants what is best for the group, we may just have different ways of going about it.  If conflict comes up, one option is to find an arbiter that both can agree to sit in on discussions of both part’s feelings and positions.</p>

<p>A general guideline and current procedures to how to go about this in a way that makes the group friends.</p>

<p>It is in the interest of the group to maintain good relations with those outside of the group. We maintain relations with the Heads of ECE, CS, the deans of Engineering and CMNS. We also maintain relationships with the staff of the Chemistry department, specifically the Chair, the Director of Operations, the Maintenance Mechanic, and so on. </p>

<p>Eric Weiss</p>

<p>I have some questions about Terrapin Hackers for you that I am going to use for a guide on running Terrapin Hackers, if that's cool</p>

<ol>
<li> What is your vision for the purpose of Terrapin Hackers/Collider?</li>
</ol><p>Shariq Hashme explain what you mean by vision</p>

<p>Eric Weiss Why did you start Terrapin Hackers?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme For lots of different reasons. I thought it would be cool if people would hack at Maryland. I thought starting a student organization would enable that. I wanted to do interesting things.</p>

<p>Generally I think making things is pretty awesome and self empowering It's hard to say why. The real answer is because I thought it would be total awesomeness.</p>

<p>Eric Weiss Seems legit. Where do you see the balance between spending time making things and spending time teaching others?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme I think people should make things with others to teach them how to make things</p>

<p>Versus lecturing or lessons So make, make, make I guess And don't forget to step back and think about it all once in a while, maybe with others, maybe on your own</p>

<p>Eric Weiss 6.   What infrastructure is needed to get students involved and making things?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme at first I thought infrastructure was needed infrastructure isn't needed but it's nice people are needed  inspiring people people to get others to go to hackathons people who make millions/billions of dollars because of the "hacker mindset" and tell students in college they can do the same if they persist things like space and hardware definitely help. but they shouldn't be the focus. the focus shouldn't be money either. the focus should be hacking.</p>

<p>Eric Weiss KK. Given ideal conditions, where would you like to see Terrapin Hackers in a year, 5 years?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme a huge network of active hackers (i.e, lots of hacks, lots of hackathon participation, potentially some interesting startups) (huge =&gt; 1000+) lots of amazing things accomplished by people who connected through terrapin hackers useful and interesting thoughts coming out of the network, which influence people globally </p>

<p>Eric Weiss 9.   How can we foster better projects and learning at hackathons?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme more people to hackathons more thinking about hacking talking to more people about hacking/hackathons leaders of terrapin hackers should identify as hackers, and aspire to be great hackers - i.e, lots of hacking lead by example take all feedback very seriously try to enable others to take on big projects</p>

<p>Eric Weiss What do you see as the difference between Terrapin Hackers and Collider?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme There will soon be a doc released about this Collider is a space for student organizations to work in. Terrapin Hackers is a student organization consisting of hackers. Collider enters into contracts with student organizations All that doesn't mean much until this new student organization starts working in Collider. Then it'll make sense</p>

<p>Eric Weiss What was your role in Terrapin Hackers, and what is your role now? </p>

<p>Shariq Hashme I was president, meaning all responsibility fell squarely on my shoulders and I had to do my best to delegate Now I act in the capacity of an advisor/overseer I largely left my position so that others would step up and do more, and so that the organization would continue to exist long after I'm gone</p>

<p>Eric Weiss What do you see as the ideal Organization of Terrapin Hackers?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme An organization decided by active hackers with fellow hackers in mind. That can, will, and should change. No need to have excessive structure. Focus on hacking.</p>

<p>Eric Weiss Who were you in contact with to Start Terrapin Hackers?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme What do you mean?</p>

<p>Eric Weiss This question is more private, but who Were your contacts at the University?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme I previously had no "contacts" other than Bryan Quinn who I had worked with through the Alumni Cup I later got to know a bunch of people in university administration, ECE, and CS</p>

<p>Eric Weiss Who?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme chairs of ECE CSdeans of CMNS EGRLee Turner university relationsStacey university relationsso many peoplepretty much everyone</p>

<p>Eric Weiss Basically who should the Organizers stay in contact with?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme chairs of ECE and CS everyone else will come by themselves</p>

<p>Eric Weiss ok 7.    What can be done about the blank canvas problem, where there is anything you can do, so it is hard to do anything at all?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme ? are you asking me what should organizers do</p>

<p>Eric Weiss sure, what do you see as solutions?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme i don't think organizers should do anything to "solve" that problem just focus on hacking</p>

<p>hacking is not working on projects hacking is messing around with technology, without necessarily having a goal in mind </p>

<p>Eric Weiss OK How important is and how can we get more people outside of STEM fields to become involved?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme Major is irrelevant to what people can and can't do More people should hack Allowing more majors to call themselves hackers means more hackers In that sense it's good People of the same major can have vastly different backgrounds. Majors don't influence background. Diverse background is arguably useful. Diverse backgrounds*</p>

<p>Eric Weiss Can you walk me through the process (in as much detail as you like) of starting Terrapin Hackers and winning MLH?</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme basically getting lots of ppl to go to hackathons and lots of thinking and a whole semester of work</p>

<p>Eric Weiss If you have time, I'd like to go into the details of what it took, if only for posterity</p>

<p>Shariq Hashme sure</p>

<p>Eric Weiss What do you see as the purpose of Terrapin Hackers? Collider?</p>

<p>Ibrahim Hashme Can you  shoot me all the questions now ill get back to you in the morning? About to pass out </p>

<p>Eric Weiss sure</p>

</ol><p>Today</p>

<p>Ibrahim Hashme skipping the first one, im not really a visionary procedures for my roles are actually very simple, I look around for people who have interesting skills and ask whether or not theyd be interested in giving a hacktorial, and usually get positive responses. So far I have been asking friends to do hacktorials, and next weeks will be the first from someone i dont know. Using friends for this is much easier than finding new people. position, head of hacktorials? responsibilities - ensuring there is someone ready to give a hacktorial every wednesday, ensuring people are aware and willing to attend it, ensuring a room is secured infrastructure is just based off one to one interactions blank canvas wasnt a problem for me, simply because I was willing to reach out. Ensuring the head of hacktorials is an outreaching person is essential. 7/8/9 dont really have anything to say about</p>

<p>Eric Weiss Run me through the process of getting a hacktorial ready- like you are training your replacement</p>

<p>Ibrahim Hashme I was close to many people in the "hacking" community, and just approached friends. I haven't really developed a method for when I don't have someone in mind.</p>

<p>Eric Weiss Once you have selected someone?</p>

<p>Ibrahim Hashme The initial method with arthur was have the present present to a board of three and they would judge/make suggestions this fell apart fairly quickly I just ensure there is someone ready for a hacktorials still working on developing a method </p>

<p>Eric Weiss What do you have so far/what are you thinking of implementing?</p>

<p>Ibrahim Hashme A system of approach Where uhh People can apply to give hacktorials thats a bit too ambitious considering i have to go around searching for hacktorials so maybe a system where finding people with specific skills is easier</p>

<p>Eric Weiss ok so what do you do to keep on people?</p>

<p>Ibrahim Hashme as in make sure they are ready?</p>

<p>Eric Weiss yea</p>

<p>Ibrahim Hashme ive only had to do that once, other than that it was people who ive seen implement the skills they were going to teach and I knew had the ability to wing a great hacktorials when i had to make sure someone was ready i just asked for a quick demo</p>

<p>Eric Weiss  when?</p>

<p>Ibrahim Hashme yeah only had to do it oncefor johns hacktorial</p>

<p>Eric Weissor, how long before do you have a demo?</p>

<p>Ibrahim Hashmeended up helping him throughout too, so i guess thats another thing. Be willing to help out throughout the hacktorialoh i did it a few hours before the actual thingThats something else that needs to be figured outi mean putting measures into effectwhich ensure high quality hacktorialsalso make them less approachable to people willing to do themIve been mostly running on trust so far-definitely not reliable</p>

<p>Eric Weissok, okWhen would you like the reviews to be, ideally?</p>

<p>Ibrahim Hashmehmm making them a set thingIm actually against the ideaThey should definitely exist, but be an agreement between the hacktorial facilitator and hacktorial headevery week</p>

<p>Eric Weissso what, exactly?</p>

<p>Ibrahim Hashmeas in"Hey lets meet here at this time, does that work for you""Yes it does"Anyways im about to shower and head for collider, get back to you then</p>

<p>Eric Weissok, thanks!</p>
