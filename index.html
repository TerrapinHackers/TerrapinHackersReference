<pre><code>The work is separated into several sections in order to make it generally readable. They are:
</code></pre>

<p>Goal and Metaorganization, which covers the overarching goal of the group and how the Organizers are organized.</p>

<p>Running Hacking, which covers the meat of what we do- get people hacking.</p>

<p>Equipment, Inventory, and Money covers our ideas about equipment, what to get and how to get it.</p>

<p>Relations, Sponsors, and Conflict covers most of what remains, Terrapin Hackers’ relations to the outside world and to each other.</p>

<pre><code>This work is intended for the Organizers of Terrapin Hackers at the University of Maryland, College Park, but it is hoped that this will be useful to anyone who is trying to foster a culture of hacking wherever they are.

<p>A note on style: it will be noticed that several terms are capitalized (such as Organizer, Hackathon, Treasurer, etc.) this is the intentional styling of the organization.</p>

<a name="cover-letter" class="anchor" href="#cover-letter"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cover Letter</h1>

<p>Hello Organizers of Terrapin Hackers, both current and future! This guide represents an attempt to cultivate and collate group knowledge and experience so that this group will have a future, and a way to look at the past.  This is a reference work, it would please me to no end if you do read this all the way through, but that is in no way required or expected in order to get the maximum out of this work.  This should be seen as a living document that will (hopefully) be updated whenever procedure changes.  Most of this work is not in a terribly formal tone as this is not a terribly formal organization. </p>

<a name="the-overall-goal-terrapin-hackers" class="anchor" href="#the-overall-goal-terrapin-hackers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The overall goal Terrapin Hackers</h3>

<p>The goal of Terrapin Hackers is to get students hacking. We live in a world where the superstars are the ones that spend their time making and creating and gaining the skills therein. We want to see a huge community of people making lots of things and lots of really cool Hackathon projects. We want to not simply be a group, but to create a culture around hacking and going to hackathons that fosters a UMD hacker identity and aspirations to be a great hacker.</p>

<p>To this end, we provide the resources needed and generally try to lower the barrier to entry for everyone.</p>

<h3>
<a name="organization-of-the-organizers-of-terrapin-hackers" class="anchor" href="#organization-of-the-organizers-of-terrapin-hackers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Organization of the organizers of Terrapin Hackers</h3>

<p>The leadership of Terrapin Hackers are the Organizers of Terrapin Hackers.  This is essentially a group of committed people who run the club and mostly try to just keep things going. Membership is open to anyone that comes to Organizers meetings and gets involved. Organizers have the right and responsibility to create sub –groups focused on their area to assist them and to delegate tasks.</p>

<p>The Organizers maintain a shared Google Drive folder, make sure you have access to it when you become an Organizer!</p>

<p>It is proposed that the Organizers operate on a consensus system, where everyone must consent or stand aside in order to pass a motion. Quorum (enough people to make a decision) is defined as having at least 5 of the named positions present. </p>

<p>There are several permanent positions, which are described here:</p>

<p>President: The President’s duties are to run Organizers meetings, to be the point-of-contact with all external groups, to keep the rest of the Organizers accountable for their actions. The president is a university-mandated position. The president also serves as SGA liaison. The Presidency is an elected position</p>

<p>Vice President: The duty of the Vice President is to assist the President in any of her duties.  The Vice Presidency is an elected position. </p>

<p>Treasurer: The position of Treasurer is a university-mandated position.  The Treasurer is in charge of all financial affairs; she maintains any budget and coordinates spending with the University. The Treasurer is an elected position</p>

<p>Hacktorial Organizer: Is the point person for coordinating and organizing Hacktorials. See: Section on Hacktorials.</p>

<p>Hack Night Organizer: Is the point person for organizing and welcoming people to Hack Night. See Section on Hack Nights.</p>

<p>Hackathon Organizer: Is the point person for getting busses to and from Hackathons. See: Section on Hackathons.</p>

<p>Hardware Organizer: In charge of keeping inventory and working with Collider to optimize hacking. See: Section on Hardware.</p>

<p>Website/Social Media Organizer: Is the point person for the Terrapin Hackers social media presence. Will have access to, and will use all of, but not limited to: administration of the Terrapin Hackers Facebook page, the <a href="https://github.com/TerrapinHackers" class="user-mention">@TerrapinHackers</a> twitter handle, the terrapinhackers.com domain, the Organizers Google Drive Folder, the Terrapin Hackers GitHub group and any other social media that may exist. The website Organizer will be in charge of keeping the website updated with any relevant information. This may be multiple positions.</p>

<p>Collider Liaison: This is not a full position, and should be combined with one of the above positions. The Collider liaison is the Organizer that is the official point-of-contact with Collider as an organization. Any Terrapin Hackers + Collider meetings must include this person.</p>

<h3>
<a name="organizers-meeting-guidelines" class="anchor" href="#organizers-meeting-guidelines"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Organizers Meeting Guidelines</h3>

<p>These guidelines should not be seen as strict rules, but as a method of organization that works elsewhere and a nice system for keeping things going.  Much of this is taken from Eric Weiss’ experience with Coop Housing, University of Maryland. It is a system that really does work and really does foster communication and moves the organization forward.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The president (or someone she designates) will create an agenda about what to talk about and how long the meeting will be, and will post at least a draft 24 hours before the meeting. Any Organizer can add something to the agenda at will. </p></li>
<li><p>The Facilitator is the person who directs the flow of the meeting and makes sure time is kept to and the agenda is actually followed. Often the President, but it is at her discretion if she wishes someone else to do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone at the meeting needs to volunteer (or the President needs to volunteer someone) to take notes.  Computers and voice recognition are acceptable if they actually work. We need a record of what happens at meetings for ourselves and for those unable to be present.</p></li>
<li><p>We have the position of Stack Taker. The Stack Taker’s job is to see when someone wants to speak and add them to the list of people who want to speak. This creates order in speaking and is an excellent way of preventing chaos and confusion.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the meeting we have checkouts where we go around and say what we are going to do once the meeting is over, any tasks we are going to do.</p></li>

<h3>
<a name="running-hack-nights" class="anchor" href="#running-hack-nights"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running hack nights</h3>

<p>"Until Midnight after a Hacktorial, hackers can experience an intense bursts of creativity-without the worries of tomorrow’s class. At hack night you bring your ideas to life, anything from a new app or a possibly famous self-sorting trash can. Nothing can stop you here, and the goal is to have something created by the end of the night." (Hackers)</p>

<p>Hack nights are all about getting people to make things. We often advertise it as a mini Hackathon for 4 hours on a weekday. </p>

<p>Set up: currently we have them start at 8 and end at midnight. Usually there are just people around Collider, so we make an effort to clean up the place and make it look nice, put stuff away, and that sort of thing. So far we have had some themed hack nights such as a Valentine’s Day themed one with paper hearts and a prize of a giant chocolate Hershey’s Kiss.</p>

<p>During the Hack Night: the Organizers role is to welcome people in (there are a lot of people who come to Collider for the first time at Hack Nights), inform them of the current happenings, facilitate team formation (if applicable), obtain any supplies or information as needed.  Or she delegates any or all of the above.</p>

<p>One idea is to have something to take apart every week, be it an old printer or a piece of scientific equipment, this gives those who have no idea what to do something to do.</p>

<h3>
<a name="organizing-hackathon-trips" class="anchor" href="#organizing-hackathon-trips"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Organizing Hackathon trips</h3>

<p>"Hack nights were so good-the hacking community created the Hackathon. They are 36 hours of productive, sleepless fun. Hackathons are where we create something incredible, in a limited amount of time." (Hackers)</p>

<p>The Hackathon Organizer is responsible for obtaining busses to Hackathons. This means contacting the organizers of the Hackathon and negotiating to get one or two busses paid for by them.  Then it means calling various bus companies and obtaining quotes from them and selecting the best one, then telling the selected bus company that we will be sending the bill to the person that will be paying for it.</p>

<p>The Hackathon Organizer is also responsible for making sure that enough people know about the Hackathon and are going to get on the bus. This involves a lot of outreach. At minimum, we have created a pinned post in the Terrapin Hackers Facebook group with a Facebook event. It should be noted that the event needs to be made public and not simply accidentally private to the group. </p>

<p>We have also created a Twilio application that participant’s text their email address to before they get on the bus so we can send out messages to everyone.  </p>

<p>We are currently having an issue with people signing up for Hackathons and not showing up. What other Universities do is have people give a $10 deposit which they get back once they get on the bus.  The problem with this is that some people simply don’t have $10 to spare. Another problem with this is that it may discourage people from going to Hackathons in the first place as it creates a barrier. </p>

<p>We never want to charge students for going to Hackathons. We want to make going to Hackathons as free and as easy as possible for participants. As such, we don’t want to ever charge people to get on a bus or to participate in anything we do.  What this means is that we only really advertise the Hackathons we actually are getting a bus for.  A result of this is that we don’t know what Hackathons we will be going to, which makes it difficult to create a list or schedule of them.</p>

<p>We have previously used McLean, DOTS, and US Coachways as our charter bus sources.</p>

<a name="running-hacktorials" class="anchor" href="#running-hacktorials"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running hacktorials</h3>

<p>Hacktorials are "Your guide to the future. Beginners and experts alike can be brought up to speed about the most relevant technologies. An immensely passionate host will give one every week, followed up by an epic hack night." (Hackers). We aim to teach people something new, usually (but not exclusively) being taught by undergraduate and graduate students.  </p>

<p>Currently, Hacktorials are held on Wednesday nights from 7-9 at changing locations. Historically, they may have been held in the Computer Science lecture hall or other classrooms. </p>

<p>The Hacktorial Organizer is responsible for ensuring that there is someone ready to give the hacktorials, make sure people are aware and willing to attend, and make sure that the room is secured for use. He also coordinates a time to go over the presentation in an informal fashion, and helps out during the hacktorials for whatever is needed. </p>

<p>Currently the Hacktorial Organizer has been reaching out to those he knows in the community that would give a good talk. He looks for people who have interesting skills and asks whether they would be interested in giving a hacktorials, and he usually gets positive responses.  The Organizer </p>

<p>Previously, we tried a system of having the presenter present a day or so before the hacktorials to a board of three people who would judge it and make suggestions.  This was found to not work.</p>

<a name="public-hacks" class="anchor" href="#public-hacks"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Public Hacks</h3>

<p>Public Hacks are hacks done outside of normal locations and events that are done primarily around the UMD campus for the purposes of fun, advertisement, and creating something cool.  These are to be a positively oriented thing that will generally reflect well on the club and University. Nothing black hat (such as putting cars on roofs) is to be associated with the group.</p>

<h3>
<a name="how-to-encourage-projects" class="anchor" href="#how-to-encourage-projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to encourage projects</h3>

<p>The primary way in which we will encourage hacking is by hacking, and having the most people hacking. To this end, we will show off peoples current projects and provide any needed resources that are requested. Maker proposes: "Keep something like an “idea rummage box" in the space, where members can throw in cool clippings and clever objects they think could inspire others. Show off the products and the process. Choose well placed shelves and wall space for showcasing examples of past projects and current activities to seed ideas and inspiration.” (Maker Media, 2013)</p>

<h2>
<a name="equipment-inventory-and-money" class="anchor" href="#equipment-inventory-and-money"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Equipment, Inventory, and Money</h2>

<p>What equipment we have and how to deal with it</p>

<p>Terrapin Hackers owns a large amount of valuable equipment. It is important that we keep track of it so that we have it to use. The first step we have decided is that equipment is generally not to leave Collider. Any exceptions should be directed towards the Hardware Organizer.  In general, we allow exceptions for things like quadcopters and GoPros, as those are primarily usable only outside collider. As well, anyone can rent things for Hackathons.  We have created a template for Hackathon equipment checkouts that is located on the Google Drive Folder.</p>

<p>Keeping equipment organized and in its place is probably one of the hardest things we do.  Most of what we have is so small, and we have not really projected the message of keeping things in the space, that much equipment is walking off.</p>

<p>Currently, we have started a system of labeling where tools go and what they are. The system seems to be a good one, however it is up to every organizer to actually tell people to put away tools so we don’t have to do it constantly ourselves.  We are in the process of getting a system of labeled boxes so we can display what hardware we have and make accessing documentation for it easier.</p>

<pre><code>The key to being Hardware Organizer not actually knowing what all the hardware does, but mostly to be willing to work with the other Organizers and Collider to optimize how it is organized and presented.  It also means being in the space very often, and helping people out when they need to find something.  It means taking initiative and realizing that everyone here is a student and really has no idea what they are doing. Talk about your ideas and then implement them. Make the system your personal hack.

The biggest problem we are going to have is the tragedy of the commons.  Briefly, the tragedy of the commons is the tendency to take an action that wholly benefits you (putting another sheep on the common green or not putting a tool away) but the downsides are shared among everyone (overgrazing and degrading of the land or not having tools in their place (Hardin, 1968). In the end, we have tools not in their place and supplies will go missing.  Harding suggests that the only way to remove this is to remove the commons aspect.  This is a dilemma. We want people to do great things, but we also want people in the future to have the resources to do things. We don’t want this to be a private club, but we do want people to care. This guidebook does not pretend to have the solution, only to show the problem is real and needs to be addressed.

<a name="what-items-we-should-buy" class="anchor" href="#what-items-we-should-buy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What items we should buy</h3>

<p>If/when money becomes available, this will be a flexible list of the priority items to obtain, as well as a general list of consumables.</p>

<p>Consumables, or items we should reasonably have to replace every so often:</p>

</table><h3>
<a name="spending-money" class="anchor" href="#spending-money"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Spending Money</h3>

<p>Money should be spent to gain the maximum benefit to the group and longevity of funds. We currently have received money from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science.  Nobody likes bureaucracy, however we want systems that are prudent and deliberate in spending money.</p>

<p>Proposed is a method for ensuring agreement and minimization of waste. In order to spend money, there must be a quorum of Organizers that is required to include the Treasurer, either the President or the vice president, and the Hardware manager (if it is a physical item being bought). This should be presented in a document that states at minimum:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The item being purchased</p></li>
<li><p>A link to the item online</p></li>
<li><p>The total cost</p></li>
<li><p>What it will be used for</p></li>
</ol><p>Once the spending is consented to, the treasurer fills out the appropriate paperwork and submits the expense to ECE, where ECE will approve or not approve of the expense.</p>

<p>As of now, we ship to ECE in AV Williams, but we could probably start shipping to the Chemistry Building if we wanted to.</p>

<pre><code>We currently do not have money that is simply ours. It is against our purpose to charge students for access to materials and/or anything we do as a club.  At times, when we can’t get a bus to a Hackathon, we do not officially promote the event, though we like to see people self-organize on Facebook.

<p>The University and ECE have stated that we are not alowed</p>

<p>Inevitably, people will break things.  We want to foster a culture that avoids punishment, as that will simply lead to things being unreported. If something is of minimal value, we won’t worry about it, as long as the person is not breaking things intentionally.   If something is more valuable, and it was an accident, it is ok, we should just talk about it at the next organizers meeting.  </p>

<h3>
<a name="conflict-resolution" class="anchor" href="#conflict-resolution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conflict resolution</h3>

<p>Conflict will inevitably happen. We establish a culture that will work to recognize each other’s feelings and acknowledge that we are not purely rational creatures (NASCO Institute, 2008). Everyone here wants what is best for the group, we may just have different ways of going about it.  If conflict comes up, one option is to find an arbiter that both can agree to sit in on discussions of both part’s feelings and positions.</p>

<p>A general guideline and current procedures to how to go about this in a way that makes the group friends.</p>

<p>It is in the interest of the group to maintain good relations with those outside of the group. We maintain relations with the Heads of ECE, CS, the deans of Engineering and CMNS. We also maintain relationships with the staff of the Chemistry department, specifically the Chair, the Director of Operations, the Maintenance Mechanic, and so on. </p>
